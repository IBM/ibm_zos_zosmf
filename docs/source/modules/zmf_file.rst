=============================================

   :depth: 1
   

Synopsis
--------
- Create, delete and operate on a z/OS UNIX System Services (USS) file or a directory on the remote z/OS system.
- The available operations include rename, change mode, change owner and change tag.





Parameters
----------


 
     
file_mode
  Specifies the permission the resulting USS file or directory should have.

  This variable only take effects when *file_state=file* or *file_state=directory*.

  If *file_path* does not exist, this value is used in creating *file_path*. If this value is omitted, 755 is used by default.

  If *file_path* exists, this value is used in changing mode of *file_path*.


  | **required**: False
  | **type**: dict


 
     
  mode
    The value of file mode bits.

    This value could be either the POSIX symbolic form (e.g., ``RWXRW-RW-``) or octal value (e.g., ``755``).


    | **required**: True
    | **type**: str


 
     
  recursive
    This variable only take effects when *file_state=directory*.

    When *recursive=true*, the file mode bits of the directory and all files in the file hierarchy below it are changed (chmod -R).


    | **required**: False
    | **type**: bool
    | **default**: false



 
     
file_owner
  Indicates the function change owner.

  This variable only take effects when *file_state=file* or *file_state=directory*.


  | **required**: False
  | **type**: dict


 
     
  group
    The group ID or GID.


    | **required**: False
    | **type**: str


 
     
  owner
    The user ID or UID.


    | **required**: True
    | **type**: str


 
     
  recursive
    This variable only take effects when *file_state=directory*.

    When *recursive=true*, changes all the files and subdirectories in that directory to belong to the specified owner and group (chown -R).


    | **required**: False
    | **type**: bool
    | **default**: false



 
     
file_path
  Path to the USS file or directory being managed.

  This variable must consist of a fully qualified path and file or directory name. For example, ``/etc/profile``.

  The module will fail if parent directory of *file_path* does not exist or is a read-only file system.


  | **required**: True
  | **type**: str


 
     
file_rename
  Specifies the new name of the USS file or directory.

  This variable only take effects when *file_state=file* or *file_state=directory*.


  | **required**: False
  | **type**: str


 
     
file_state
  The final state desired for specified USS file or directory.

  If *file_state=file* and *file_path* does not exist, *file_path* is created as a USS file, the module completes successfully with ``changed=True``.


  If *file_state=directory* and *file_path* does not exist, *file_path* is created as a directory, the module completes successfully with ``changed=True``.


  If *file_state=file* or *file_state=directory*, and *file_path* exists, *file_path* is modified with other supplied variables (e.g., *file_mode*), the module completes successfully with ``changed=True``.


  If *file_state=file* or *file_state=directory*, and *file_path* exists, no action taken if no other variables are supplied (e.g., *file_mode*), the module completes successfully with ``changed=False``.


  If *file_state=absent* and *file_path* does not exist, no action taken, the module completes successfully with ``changed=False``.


  If *file_state=absent* and *file_path* exists, the existing *file_path* is deleted, the module completes successfully with ``changed=True``.



  | **required**: True
  | **type**: str
  | **choices**: file, directory, absent


 
     
file_tag
  Indicates the function change tag.

  This variable only take effects when *file_state=file* or *file_state=directory*.


  | **required**: False
  | **type**: dict


 
     
  codeset
    Specifies the coded character set in which text data is encoded, such as ASCII or EBCDIC.

    For example, the code set for ASCII is ISO8859â€“1; the code set for EBCDIC is IBM-1047.

    This variable only take effects when *tag=mixed* or *tag=text*.

    This variable is required when *tag=text*.


    | **required**: False
    | **type**: str

    | **type**: bool
    | **default**: false
