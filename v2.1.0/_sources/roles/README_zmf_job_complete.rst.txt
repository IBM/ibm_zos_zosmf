  | **type**: str
  | **default**: LOCAL
  | **choices**: LOCAL, DATASET, USS

job_internal_reader_class
  A single character that specifies the internal reader class to define the default message class (MSGCLASS) for the job.

  | **required**: False
  | **type**: str
  | **default**: A

job_internal_reader_recfm
  A single character that specifies the internal reader record format: ``F`` or ``V``.  
  
  * When submitting a job from a data set, you can omit this header. Otherwise, this value must match the record format of the data set.
  
  * When not submitting a job from a data set, if you omit this header or specify a value other than ``F`` or ``V``, the default of ``F`` is used.

  | **required**: False
  | **type**: str
  
job_internal_reader_lrecl
  An integer value that specifies the internal reader logical record length (LRECL).
  
  * When submitting a job from a data set, you can omit this header. Otherwise, this value must match the LRECL of the data set.
  
  * When not submitting a job from a data set, if you omit this header or specify a non-integer value, the default of 80 is used.

  | **type**: str
  | **choices**: RECORD, TEXT, BINARY

job_user_correlator
  Specifies the user portion of the job correlator. 
  
  In z/OS, a job correlator can be used to associate each job with a unique 64-character value. The correlator provides you with a means to query a job in the system and track it through execution.  
  A job correlator consists of a 31-byte system-defined portion and a colon character ``:``, followed by a 32-byte user portion. 
  
  This value is 1 – 32 characters in length, where the first character must be uppercase alphabetic (A-Z) or special ($, #, @). The remaining characters (up to 31) can be any combination of uppercase alphabetic, numeric (0-9), or special. Blank characters are not supported.

  | **required**: False
  | **type**: str
  
job_symbols
  This variable is a dictionary which specifies the name and value for JCL symbols.

  A symbol name is 1 – 8 characters, where the first character must be uppercase alphabetic (A-Z) or special ($, #, @). The remaining characters (up to 7) can be any combination of uppercase alphabetic, numeric (0-9), or special.

  A symbol value is limited to 255 characters. Multiple symbol names and values can be specified, up to a limit of 128.

  For example:

  .. code-block:: sh
     
     {
       "symbol1": "value1",
       "symbol2": "value2"
     }

  | **required**: False
  | **type**: dict

job_search_logic
  Specifies the logic between the check of the job return code and job output. This variable only take effects when *job_search_output* is defined.
  
  * **AND**: The role will succeed only when both the return code is matched with *job_max_rc* and the job output is matched with *job_search_output*. If the return code doesn't match with *job_max_rc*, the role will fail and the remaining tasks to check the job output will be bypassed.
  
  * **OR**: the role will succeed if either the return code is match with *job_max_rc*, or the job output is matched with *job_search_output*. Both tasks to check the return code and job output will no be bypassed no matter wether it is mismatched.

  | **required**: False
  | **type**: str
  | **default**: AND
  | **choices**: AND, OR

job_max_rc
  An integer value that specifies the maximum return code for the job that should be allowed without failing the role.

  * When *job_search_logic=AND*, the role will fail if the return code doesn't match ``CC nnnn`` where nnnn is small or equal to the maximum return code.
  
  * When *job_search_logic=OR*, the role will continue to check the job output if *job_search_output* is defined, even the return code doesn't match ``CC nnnn`` where nnnn is small or equal to the maximum return code.

  | **required**: False
  | **type**: int
  | **default**: 0

job_search_output
  A string or a regular expression specifies the matched part of job output that should be allowed without failing the role.
  
  Use *job_search_output_ddname* to specify the spool file list in which you want to do the match work.
  
  * When *job_search_logic=AND*, the role will fail if no matched output content is found.

  * When *job_search_logic=OR*, the role will succeed if either the return code is small or equal to the maximum return code, or the matched output contents are found.

  | **required**: False
  | **type**: str

job_search_output_ddname
  A list specifies the list of spool files in which the match work will be done. For example: ``["JESMSGLG", "JESJCL"]``. 
  
  This variable only take effects when *job_search_output* is defined. The spool files listed in this variable will be compared with *job_search_output*. If this variable is omitted, all spool files will be compared with *job_search_output*.

  | **required**: False
  | **type**: list

job_search_output_insensitive
  Specifies whether the comparison of *job_search_output* is case insensitive. This variable only take effects when *job_search_output* is defined.

  | **required**: False
  | **type**: bool
  | **default**: True

job_search_output_maxreturnsize
  An integer specifies how many lines of contents from the first matched line in spool file will be returned when *job_search_output* is matched in *job_search_output_ddname*.

  | **required**: False
  | **type**: int
  | **default**: 1

complete_check_times
  The maximum number of time that is used for periodic checks of the job status.

  | **required**: False
  | **type**: int
  | **default**: 10

complete_check_delay
  The interval time between periodic checks of the job status.

  | **required**: False
  | **type**: int
  | **default**: 5
