     gather_facts: no
     collections:
       - ibm.ibm_zos_zosmf
     vars_prompt:

         vars:
           job_jcl_src: "files/job_sample_jcl.jcl" # The location of file or data set containing the JCL

.. note::

  To run the sample playbook, the inventory file `hosts`_ needs to be updated to identify the target z/OSMF end points.
